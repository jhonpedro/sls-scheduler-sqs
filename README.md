## Schedule with SQS queue

This project is manly for creating a base scheduler and test the implementantion of an SQS queue. And see how it's made the whole configuration, including the creation of a SQS queue in `sls.ts`.

I did'nt managed to setup a copy of the `.ejs` files to the bundle but it works fine without it.

Looking know I much prefer webpack for the bundle responsability. I don't know but I spent a lot of time trying to make a copy of some files and the time that I did it with Webpack it was so much easier. I have to study more about [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) too.
